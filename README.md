# Practice

I love challenges or in other words, tough nuts to crack. Here are some of my 
solutions to exercises from usaco, codeforces, etc. My solutions might not be the most efficient ones, but I did on my own and had a lot of fun. 

## Programming Contest Problem Types

[source from usaco](http://train.usaco.org/usacotext2?a=rcHbjhaLEkv&S=probs) 

Have learned:
* Greedy
* Minimum Spanning 
* Shortest Path
* Ad Hoc Problem (I don't think there is a good way to learn this)


Have** NOT** learned:
* Dynamic Programming
* Complete Search
* Flood Fill
* Shortest Path
* Recursive Search Techniques
* Minimum Spanning Tree
* Knapsack
* Computational Geometry
* Network Flow
* Eulerian Path
* Two-Dimensional Convex Hull

* Heuristic Search
* Approximate Search



**Updates:**
* 02/07/2016 start my journey
* 05/07/2016 (usaco) Section1.1 _ride.c_ _gitf1.c_
* 07/07/2016 (usaco) Section1.1 _friday.c_
* 20/02/2017 (cf) Theatre Square
<<<<<<< HEAD
* 24/02/2017 (cc) a+b
* 27/02/2017 (usaco) test, ride 


**TODO:**
* improve C++/C skills (pinned)
* understand input/output stream
* understand gcc/g++ 
* [g++ usage](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~myers/howto/g++compiling.txt)
* rewrite usaco PROB greedy, friday, necklace in C++11
