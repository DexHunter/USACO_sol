# Practice

Solutions to several code practices, including usaco, codeforces, etc. My solutions might not be the most efficient ones, but I did on my own and had a lot of fun. 

## Programming Contest Problem Types

[source from usaco](http://train.usaco.org/usacotext2?a=rcHbjhaLEkv&S=probs) 

Have learned:
* Greedy
* Minimum Spanning 
* Shortest Path
* Ad Hoc Problems (Well, I don't think there is a way to learn this)

**Have NOT learned:
* Dynamic Programming
* Complete Search
* Flood Fill
* Recursive Search Techniques
* Knapsack
* Computational Geometry
* Network Flow
* Eulerian Path
* Two-Dimensional Convex Hull
* BigNums
* Heuristic Search
* Approximate Search

**Updates:**
* 02/07/2016 start my journey
* 05/07/2016 (usaco) Section1.1 _ride.c_ _gitf1.c_
* 07/07/2016 (usaco) Section1.1 _friday.c_
* 20/02/2017 (cf) Theatre Square
* 24/02/2017 (cc) a+b
* 27/02/2017 (usaco) test, ride 


**TODO:**
* improve C++/C skills (pinned)
* understand input/output stream
* understand gcc/g++ 
* [g++ usage](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~myers/howto/g++compiling.txt)
* rewrite usaco PROB greedy, friday, necklace
